*"marky.js is a JavaScript tool that automatically applies classes to code features -- letting you easily apply the full power of CSS to your writing"*

**Usage**

Using marky.js is simple! If you have a block of code that you want to style, just wrap it like so: `<div class="codeSection"> var x=5; </div>`.

marky.js can span lines too, so if you have a large section of code **you only need to wrap the code once**.
`<div class="codeSection">`
` ... your lines of code ... `
`</div>`

If you don't specify a language, marky.js will try to interpret the language and features for you; however, **you can always specify the language**.
`<div class="codeSection" language="JavaScript"> ... </div>`
